                        I have developed a framework for accurately predicting eye movements from high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets.
                        <br><br>
                        Applied various Machine Learning algorithms and assessing their performance using metrics such as Recall, Precision, Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

                        After applying ML Models, I analyze them to predict eye movement.

                        Using ML algorithms, I've developed models based on factors like molecular weight, solute concentration, and temperature to forecast  polymer viscosity of glass.

                        Through rigorous evaluation using Multinomial NB, Gaussian NB, MLP Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier, I've achieved impressive 
                        accuracy results of up to 95%.
