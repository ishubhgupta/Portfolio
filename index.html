                        This paper presents a framework for accurately predicting eye movements using EEG data and machine learning classifiers. We tested various algorithms including Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and Random Forest, achieving up to 96% accuracy with Random Forest. I, Shubh Gupta, as the main author, contributed to the machine learning implementation and the writing of the paper, with support from my co-authors. The findings offer significant insights for improving models in bioinformatics and enhancing our understanding of visual perception and attention.
